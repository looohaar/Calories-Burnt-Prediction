# Calories Burnt Prediction

This project aims to predict the number of calories burnt based on various input features using the XGBoost Regressor machine learning model. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, and all coding and analysis are conducted in a Colab Notebook.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the number of calories burnt during physical activities. This can be useful for fitness enthusiasts and professionals looking to monitor and optimize workout routines.

## Libraries Used

* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
* Matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
* XGBoost Regressor: For building the regression model.
* Scikit-Learn: For preprocessing, model evaluation, and utility functions.

## Coding Environment

The entire project is developed in a Colab Notebook, providing an interactive and convenient platform for coding, visualization, and collaboration.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of the XGBoost Regressor to predict calories burnt based on physical activity data. The model achieves accurate predictions with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1.48. This indicates the model's effectiveness in estimating the calories burnt, and it can be further refined and adapted for real-world use.
